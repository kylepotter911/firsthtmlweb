  <h4>What is DTP</h4>
  <p>A drug-therapy (related) problem can be defined as an event or circumstance involving drug treatment (pharmacotherapy) that interferes with the optimal provision of medical care. In 1990, L.M. Strand and her colleagues (based on the previous work of R.L Mikeal and D.C Brodie, published respectively in 1975 and 1980) classified the DTPs into eight different categories. According to these categories, pharmacists generated a list of the DTPs for each patient. As a result, pharmacists had a cleaner picture of the patient's drug therapy and medical conditions.</p>
  <p>A second publication of R.J Cipolle with L.M Strand in 1998, change the eight categories into seven, grouped in four Pharmacotherapy needs: indication, effectiveness, safety and adherence.</p>

<table>
<thead>
  <th>The original eight problems have now been condensed into seven categories of problems. As given by Shargel, they are:</th>
</thead>
<tr>
  <td>1.	Unnecessary drug therapy. This could occur when the patient has been placed on too many medications for their condition and the drug is simply not needed.  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2.	Wrong drug. This could occur when a patient is given medication that does not treat the patient's condition. Ex. A heart medication to treat an infection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>3.	Dose too low. This could occur when a patient is given medication that is not strong enough to get beneficial or therapeutic effects. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>4.	Dose too high. This could occur when a patient is given medication that is too strong and is causing detrimental effects or is simply not necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>5.	Adverse drug reaction. This could occur when a patient has an allergic response to a medication. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>6.	Inappropriate adherence. This could occur when a patient chooses not to or forgets to take a medication. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>7.	Needs additional drug therapy. This could occur when a patient needs more medication to treat their condition.</td>
</tr>
